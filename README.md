<h1>Welcome to CloudMusic!</h1>

This is a group project that I made with my team at RMIT University.

<h2>1/ Product description</h2>

The goal of our project is to create a website that delivers lawfully copyrighted music to businesses and organizations that use music in their operations. “CloudMusic” will be the name of our website. “CloudMusic” offers a secure, transparent, and copyright-compliant music service, as well as publicity and delivery alternatives for musicians. In addition, our website sells copyrighted music and provides a list of tracks under contract to third-party clients such as service companies, restaurants, hotels, cafés, and individual customers. 
Businesses and organizations must use legal music following copyright law, including copyright and related rights when used for their own business purpose. For example, a clothing store plays a music playlist to attract more customers, which means that the store uses music for business purposes, and they have to pay the license fees to the music producers. Furthermore, with the necessity for music to boost company selling efficiency, “CloudMusic” promises to produce appropriate music tracks and playlists (genre or albums) for personal use with lower royalty fees when compared to other websites on the market. It is necessary to update your music lists to refresh the atmosphere daily, attracting and retaining the customers’ excitement without changing the style. As a result, companies may freely pick their music based on their style and tastes, as well as the necessities of each business model, without having to worry about contacting the copyright owner, or the threat of being sued over "intellectual property" and "music copyright" concerns. Besides, our website assists music producers in distributing their songs to worldwide markets, expanding their reach to a bigger audience, and profiting from their efforts. Artists can earn money from individuals or organizations who utilize their copyrighted songs for commercial reasons, and they can view monthly reports on their music.

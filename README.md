<h2>1/ Product description</h2>

The goal of our project is to create a website that delivers lawfully copyrighted music to businesses and organizations that use music in their operations. “CloudMusic” will be the name of our website. “CloudMusic” offers a secure, transparent, and copyright-compliant music service, as well as publicity and delivery alternatives for musicians. In addition, our website sells copyrighted music and provides a list of tracks under contract to third-party clients such as service companies, restaurants, hotels, cafés, and individual customers. <br /><br />
